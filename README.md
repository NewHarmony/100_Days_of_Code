# 100_Days_of_Code

Coding projects in:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* React
* Vue
* Python
* Data Science/ML
* Django
* SQL
* Excel
* Tableau

The idea is to code frequently enough that solutions, design, and integration of the above will become more intuitive. i.e less googling and better workflow ;)
The projects will probably range from beginner to intermediate for the most part as the idea is simply for skill reinforcement by frequency.
